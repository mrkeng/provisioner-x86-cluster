This repo is a complex set of examples for system automation with Ansible. It will show a complete model of automated system provisioning using the Ansible frameworks. It's written in modular structure for ease of maintenance.

This system provisioning tool also implements the changes being noted in my FHS v3.0 draft proposal.

Adjutant, the chatbot, will use this tool along with nlp-analyzer and several other tools to demonstrate a basic system provisioning via English.
